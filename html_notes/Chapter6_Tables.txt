WHAT'S A TABLE?
	A table represents information in a grid format. Examples of table include financial reports,TV schedules, and sports results.

Grids allow us to understand complex data by referencing information in two axes.
Each block in the grid is referred to as a table cell. In HTML, a table is written out row by row.

BASIC TABLE STRUCTURE:

1.<table> tag: The <table> element is used to create a table. The contents of the table are written out row by row.

2.<tr> tag: You indicate the start of each row using the opening <tr> tag. (The tr stands for table row.) It is followed by one or more
            <td> elements (one for each cell in that row). At the end of the row you use a closing </tr> tag.
			
3.<td> tag: Each cell of a table is represented using a <td> element. (The td stands for table data.) At the end of each cell you use a
            closing </td> tag.
			
TABLE HEADINGS:

1.<th> tag: The <th> element is used just like the <td> element but its purpose is to represent the heading for either a column or
            a row. (The th stands for table heading.)
			Even if a cell has no content,you should still use a <td> or <th> element to represent the presence of an empty cell
            otherwise the table will not render correctly.  
			You can use the scope attribute on the <th> element to indicate whether it is a heading for a column or a row. It can take the
            values: row to indicate a heading for a row or col to indicate a heading for a column.
            Browsers usually display the content of a <th> element in bold and in the middle of the cell.			
			
SPANNING COLUMNS:
            Sometimes you may need the entries in a table to stretch across more than one column. The colspan attribute can be
            used on a <th> or <td> element and indicates how many columns that cell should run across.
			
SPANNING ROWS:
            You may also need entries in a table to stretch down across more than one row. The rowspan attribute can be
            used on a <th> or <td> element to indicate how many rows a cell should span down the table.
			
LONG TABLE:
            There are three elements that help distinguish between the main content of the table and the first and last rows (
			(which can contain different content).
			
1. <thead> tag: The headings of the table should sit inside the <thead> element.
2. <tbody> tag: The body should sit inside the <tbody> element.
3. <tfoot> tag: The footer belongs inside the <tfoot> element.

TABLE ATTRIBUTES:

OLD ATTRIBUTES OF THE TABLE WHICH ARE COMPLETELY REMOVED IN HTML5 AND USING CSS3:

1. WIDTH AND SPACING:
                     The width attribute was used on the opening <table> tag to indicate how wide that table should be and on some opening
                     <th> and <td> tags to specify the width of individual cells. The value of this attribute is the width of the table or 
					 cell in pixels.
					 The opening <table> tag could also use the cellpadding attribute to add space inside each cell of the table, and the
                     cellspacing attribute to create space between each cell of the table. The values for these attributes were given in pixels.
					 
2. BORDER AND BACKGROUND:
                     The border attribute was used on both the <table> and <td> elements to indicate the width of the border in pixels.
                     The bgcolor attribute was used to indicate background colors of either the entire table or individual table cells. 
					 The value is usually a hex code.
