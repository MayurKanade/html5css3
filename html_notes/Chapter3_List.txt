There are 3 types of List:
1. Ordered List
2. Unordered List
3. Definition List

1. Ordered List: Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is numbered. 
                 For example, the list might be a set of steps for
                 a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract
                 where each point needs to be identified by a section number.

   Ordered List is created with the <ol> element
   Each item in the list is placed between an opening <li> tag and a closing </li> tag. (The li stands for list item.)
   e.g.:
   <ol>
		<li>Chop potatoes into quarters</li>
		<li>Simmer in salted water for 15-20
		minutes until tender</li>
		<li>Heat milk, butter and nutmeg</li>
		<li>Drain potatoes and mash</li>
		<li>Mix in the milk mixture</li>
   </ol>


2. Unordered List: Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point
                  (rather than characters that indicate order).
				 
	The unordered list is created with the <ul> element.
	Each item in the list is placed between an opening <li> tag and a closing </li> tag. (The li stands for list item.)
	Browsers indent lists by default
	Sometimes you may see a type attribute used with the <ul> element to specify the type of bullet point (circles, squares,diamonds and so on)
	e.g.:
	<ul>
         <li>1kg King Edward potatoes</li>
         <li>100ml milk</li>
         <li>50g salted butter</li>
         <li>Freshly grated nutmeg</li>
         <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
				  
3. Definition List: Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the
                    definitions for each of those terms.
					
    The definition list is created with the <dl> element and usually consists of a series of terms and their definitions.
	Inside the <dl> element you will usually see pairs of <dt> and <dd> elements.
	
	A. <dt>: This is used to contain the term being defined (the definition term).
	B. <dd>: This is used to contain the definition
	
	Sometimes you might see a list where there are two terms used for the same definition or two different definitions for the same term.
	e.g.:
	     <dl>
                    <dt>Sashimi</dt>
                    <dd>Sliced raw fish that is served with
                    condiments such as shredded daikon radish or
                    ginger root, wasabi and soy sauce</dd>
                    <dt>Scale</dt>
                    <dd>A device used to accurately measure the
                    weight of ingredients</dd>
                    <dd>A technique by which the scales are removed
                    from the skin of a fish</dd>
                    <dt>Scamorze</dt>
                    <dt>Scamorzo</dt>
                    <dd>An Italian cheese usually made from whole
                    cow's milk (although it was traditionally made
                    from buffalo milk)</dd>
        </dl>

4. Nested List: You can put a second list inside an <li> element to create a sublist or nested list.
                Browsers display nested lists indented further than the parent list. In nested unordered lists,
                the browser will usually change the style of the bullet point too.
	e.g.:
	<ul>
			<li>Mousses</li>
			<li>Pastries
			<ul>
			<li>Croissant</li>
			<li>Mille-feuille</li>
			<li>Palmier</li>
			<li>Profiterole</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Tarts</li>
    </ul>
