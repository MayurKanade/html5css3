Comments in HTML:
                     The comments are not visible to users in the main browser window, they can be viewed by anyone who looks at 
					 the source code behind the page.

Syntactical Representation: <!-- comment goes here -->


1. id Attribute    : Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the
				     page. Its value should start with a letter or an underscore (not a number or any other character). 
				     It is important that no two elements on the same page have the same value for their id attributes 
				     (otherwise the value is no longer unique).
				     
				     The id attribute is known as a global attribute because it can be used on any element
				 
2. class Attribute : Every HTML element can also carry a class attribute. Sometimes, rather than uniquely identifying one element within
					 a document, you will want a way to identify several elements as being different from the other elements on the page.
					 
3. Block Elements  : Some elements will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window. These are known as block level elements.
                     Examples of block elements are <h1>, <p>, <ul>, and <li>.
					 
4. Inline Elements : Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements. 
                     These are known as inline elements.
					 Examples of inline elements are <a>, <b>, <em>, and <img>.
					 

Grouping Text and Elements in a Block:

1. <div> Element   : The <div> element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box.
                     For example, you might create a <div> element to contain all of the elements for the header
                     of your site (the logo and the navigation), or you might create a <div> element to contain comments from visitors.
					 
                     In a browser, the contents of the <div> element will start on a new line, but other than this it will make no difference 
					 to the presentation of the page.

                     Using an id or class attribute on the <div> element, however, means that you can create CSS style rules to 
					 indicate how much space the <div> element should occupy on the screen and change the appearance of all 
					 the elements contained within it.
					 
					 It can also make it easier to follow your code if you have used <div> elements to hold each section of the page.


Grouping Text and Elements Inline:

1. <span> Element  : The <span> element acts like an inline equivalent of the <div> element. It is used to either: 
                     
					 A. Contain a section of text where there is no other suitable element to differentiate it from its surrounding text.
					 B. Contain a number of inline elements.
					 


IFRAMES:
           
1. <iframe> Element : An iframe is like a little window that has been cut into your page — and in that window you can see another page. 
                      The term iframe is an abbreviation of inline frame.		   
					  One common use of iframes (that you may have seen on various websites) is to embed a Google Map into a page. 
					  The content of the iframe can be any html page (either located on the same server or anywhere else on the web).
					  
Attributes of the iframe:

1. src         : The src attribute specifies the URL of the page to show in the frame.
2. height      : The height attribute specifies the height of the iframe in pixels.
3. width       : The width attribute specifies the width of the iframe in pixels.
4. scrolling   : The scrolling attribute will not be supported in HTML5. In HTML 4 and XHTML, it indicates whether the iframe should
                 have scrollbars or not. This is important if the page inside the iframe is larger than the space you have allowed for it 
			     (using the height and width attributes). Scrollbars allow the user to move around the frame to see more content. 
			     It can take one of three values: yes (to show scrollbars),no (to hide scrollbars) and auto (to show them only if needed).
5. frameborder : The frameborder attribute will not be supported in HTML5. In HTML 4 and XHTML, it indicates whether the frame should have
                 a border or not. A value of 0 indicates that no border should be shown. A value of 1 indicates that a border should be shown.
6. seamless    : In HTML5, a new attribute called seamless can be applied to an iframe where scrollbars are not desired. 
                 The seamless attribute (like some other new HTML5 attributes) does not need a value, but you will often see authors give it a value of
                 seamless. Older browsers do not support the seamless attribute.

e.g.:   
        <iframe src="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=moma+new+york &amp;output=embed" width="450" height="350" frameborder="0" scrolling="no">
        </iframe>


Inforamtion about your pages:

1.<meta> Element : The <meta> element lives inside the <head> element and contains information about that web page. 
                   It is not visible to users but fulfills a number of purposes such as telling search engines about your page, 
				   who created it, and whether or not it is time sensitive. (If the page is time sensitive, it can be set to expire.)
				   
				   The <meta> element is an empty element so it does not have a closing tag. It uses attributes to carry the information.
				  
The <meta> element has only two attributes and they're 1.name and 2.content
The value of the name attribute is the property you are setting.
The value of the content attribute is the value that you want to give to this property.

There are some standard values defined inside the name attribute and they are commonly used.

1.  description : This contains a description of the page. This description is commonly used by search engines to understand 
                  what the page is about and should be a maximum of 155 characters. Sometimes it is also displayed in search engine results.
				  
2.  keywords    : This contains a list of commaseparated words that a user might search on to find the page. 
                  In practice, this no longer has any noticeable effect on how search engines index your site.
				  
3.  robots      : This indicates whether search engines should add this page to their search results or not. 
                  A value of noindex can be used if this page should not be added. A value of nofollow can be used if search engines should add this
                  page in their results but not any pages that it links to.
				  
The meta element also uses the http-equivalent and content attributes in pairs.
Each content has different purpose and they are as follows:

1.  author      : This defines the author of the web page.
2.  pragma      : This defines the user from caching the web page. (i.e. storing it locally to save time downloading it on subsequent visits.)
3.  expires     : Because browsers often cache the content of a page, the expires option can be used to indicate when the page 
                  should expire (and no longer be cached). Note that the date must be specified in the format shown.
				  e.g. <meta http-equiv="expires" content="Fri, 04 Apr 2014 23:59:59 GMT" />
				  

e.g.:

                                                        <!DOCTYPE html>
                                                        <html>
                                                            <head>
                                                            <title>Information About Your Pages</title>
                                                            <meta name="description"
                                                            content="An Essay on Installation Art" />
                                                            <meta name="keywords"
                                                            content="installation, art, opinion" />
                                                            <meta name="robots"
                                                            content="nofollow" />
                                                            <meta http-equiv="author"
                                                            content="Jon Duckett" />
                                                            <meta http-equiv="pragma"
                                                            content="no-cache" />
                                                            <meta http-equiv="expires"
                                                            content="Fri, 04 Apr 2014 23:59:59 GMT" />
                                                            </head>
                                                            <body>
                                                            </body>
                                                        </html>
														
ESCAPE CHARACTERS:

There are some characters that are used in and reserved by HTML code. (For example, the left and right angled brackets.)
e.g.:

1. < Less than sign      : &lt; &#60;
2. > Greater than sign   : &gt; &amp;
3. £ Pound sign          : &pound; &#163;
4. ¤ Euro  sign          : &euro; &#8364;
5. © Copyright symbol    : &copy; &#169;
6. × Multiplication sign : &times;&#215;
