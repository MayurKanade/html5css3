Tags are of two types:
1. Structural Markup: The elements that you can use to describe the both headings and paragraphs.
2. Semantic   Markup: Which provides extra information; e.g. emphasis is placed in a sentence.

1. Structural Markup: Describe both headings and paragraphs.

I. HEADINGS
   . HTML has six levels of headings.
     <h1> is used for main heading.
	 <h2> is used for subheadings.
	 <h3> further sections under the subheadings then we use h3 elements
	 <h1> is largest and <h6> is smallest.
	 
II. <b> (Bold text tag): By enclosing words in the tags <b> and </b> we can make characters appear bold.
                     e.g. <p>Inside a product description you might see some <b>key features</b> in bold.</p>
		
III. <i> (Italic text tag): By enclosing words in the tags <i> and </i> we can make characters appear italic.
                     e.g. <p>Captain Cook sailed to Australia on the <i>Endeavour</i>.</p>
		 
IV. <sup> (SuperScript tag): The <sup> element is used to contain characters that should be superscript such as the suffixes 
                         of dates or mathematical concepts like raising a number to a power such as 2^2
		                 e.g. <p>On the 4<sup>th</sup> of September you will learn about E=MC<sup>2</sup>.</p>
		  
V. <sub> (Subscript tag): The <sub> element is used to contain characters that should be subscript. It is commonly used with foot notes or chemical
                       formulas such as H20.
					   e.g. <p>The amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere grew by 2ppm in 2009<sub>1</sub>.</p>
					   
VI. <br /> (Breaking the Line tag): The browser will automatically show each new paragraph or heading on a new line. But if you wanted 
                                to add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph you can use the line break tag <br />.
								e.g. <p>The Earth<br />gets one hundred tons heavier every day<br />due to falling space dust.</p>
								
VII. <hr /> (Horizontal Rule tag) : To create a break between themes — such as a change of topic in a book or a new scene in a play — you can add a
                               horizontal rule between sections using the <hr /> tag.
							   e.g. <p>Venus is the only planet that rotates clockwise.</p> <hr /> <p>Jupiter is bigger than all the other planets combined.</p>
							   

2. Semantic Markup: There are some text elements that are not intented to affect the structure of your web page but they do add extra information to web page.

A. <strong> (emphasis on special text): The use of the <strong> element indicates that its content has strong importance.
                                        For example, the words contained in this element might be said with strong emphasis
                                        By default, browsers will show the contents of a <strong> element in bold.  										
										
B. <em> (shows the text in italic): The <em> element indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentence.

C. <blockquote> (start (a line of text) or position (a block of text) further from the margin than the main part of the text)
                                       : The <blockquote> element is used for longer quotes that take up an entire paragraph.  

D. <q> (a shorter quote which sits in the paragraph) : Browsers are suppossed to put quotes around the <q> element.
                                       e.g.: <blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnie-the-Pooh">
                                             <p>Did you ever stop to think, and forget to start again?</p>
                                             </blockquote> 
											 <p>As A.A. Milne said, <q>Some people talk to animals. Not many listen though. That's the problem.</q></p>

Both elements may use the cite attribute to indicate where the quote is from. Its value should be a URL that will have more information 
about the source of the quotation.

E. <abbr> : If you use an abbreviation or an acronym, then the <abbr> element can be used.A title attribute on the opening tag is used to specify the full term.
            e.g. <p><acronym title="National Aeronautics and Space Administration">NASA</acronym> do some crazy space stuff.</p>  

F. <cite> : When you are referencing a piece of work such as a book, film or research paper, the <cite> element can be used to indicate where the citation is
            from.
			e.g.: <p><cite>A Brief History of Time</cite> by Stephen Hawking has sold over ten million copies worldwide.</p>
			
G. <dfn> : The <dfn> element is used to indicate the defining instance of a new term.
           The first time you explain some new terminology (perhaps an academic concept or some jargon) in a document, it is known as the defining instance
           of it.    

H. <address> : The <address> element has quite a specific use: to contain contact details for the author of the page.
               It can contain a physical address,but it does not have to. For example, it may also contain a phone number or email address.
               e.g.: <address><p><a href="mailto:homer@example.org">homer@example.org</a></p><p>742 Evergreen Terrace, Springfield.</p></address> 			   

I. <ins> : The <ins> element can be used to show content that has been inserted into a document.
   <del> : The <del> element can show text that has been deleted from it.
   <s>   : The <s> element indicates something that is no longer accurate or relevant (but that should not be deleted).
           e.g. : <p>Laptop computer:</p> <p><s>Was $995</s></p> <p>Now only $375</p>
