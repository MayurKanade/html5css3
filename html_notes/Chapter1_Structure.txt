HTML Tags are often referred to as Elements.
HTML Element is made up of characters that live inside opening tags and closing tags. e.g <p> and </p>
HTML Elements: Each HTML element tells the browser something about information that sits between its opening and closing tag.
Attributes: Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element and are made of two parts: (a name and a value.) key-value pair.
            Attribute name indicates what kind of information you are supplying about the element's content. It should be written in lowercase.
            e.g.  <p lang="en-us">Paragraph in English </p>
