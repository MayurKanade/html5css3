There are many reasons why you might want to add an image to a web page: 
you might want to include a logo, photograph,illustration, diagram, or chart.

1. Include an image in your web pages using HTML
2. Pick which image format to use
3. Show an image at the right size
4. Optimize an image for use on the web to make pages load faster 

Choosing Images for Your Site:
A picture can say a thousand words, and great images help make the difference between an average-looking site and a really engaging one.

Images should:
1. Be relevant
2. Convey information
3. Convey the right mood
4. Be instantly recognisable
5. Fit the color palette

Stock photos : Should use paid sites for your images because of @copyrights.

Storing Images:
If you are building a site from scratch, it is good practice to create a folder for all of the images
the site uses.
For example, images such as logos and buttons might sit in a folder called interface, 
product photographs might sit in a page called products, 
and images related to news might live in a folder called news.

Tags Used:
1. <img> tag: In HTML To add an image into the page you need to use an <img> element. This is an empty element 
              (which means there is no closing tag). It must carry the following two attributes:

I. Attributes of <img> tag:

1. src   : This tells the browser where it can find the image file. This will usually be a relative URL
           pointing to an image on your own site.
2. alt   : This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it.
3. title : To provide additional information about the image. Most browsers will display the content of this
           attribute in a tooltip when the user hovers over the image.
		   
II. Properties of <img> tag (are also an attributes):

1. Height : This specifies the height of the image in pixels.
2. Width  : This specifies the width of the image in pixels.
            Images often take longer to load than the HTML code that makes up the rest of the page. It is, therefore, a good idea to
            specify the size of the image so that the browser can render the rest of the text on the page while leaving the right amount of
            space for the image that is still loading.

Where to Place Images in Your Code (That really matters a lot):

1. Before a paragraph: The paragraph starts on a new line after the image.
e.g.: 
<img src="images/bird.gif" alt="Bird" width="100" height="100" />
<p>There are around 10,000 living species of birds
that inhabit different ecosystems from the
Arctic to the Antarctic. Many species undertake
long distance annual migrations, and many more
perform shorter irregular journeys.</p>

2. Inside the start of a paragraph: The first row of text aligns with the bottom of the image.
e.g.:
<p>
<img src="images/bird.gif" alt="Bird" width="100" height="100" />
There are around 10,000 living
species of birds that inhabit different
ecosystems from the Arctic to the Antarctic. Many
species undertake long distance annual
migrations, and many more perform shorter
irregular journeys.</p>

3. In the middle of a paragraph: The image is placed between the words of the paragraph that it appears in.
e.g.:
<p>There are around 10,000 living species of birds
that inhabit different ecosystems from the
Arctic to the Antarctic.<img src="images/bird.gif" alt="Bird" width="100" height="100" />Many species undertake long
distance annual migrations, and many more perform
shorter irregular journeys.</p>

III. ALIGNING IMAGES HORIZONTALLY (It was in older code of HTML and not present in HTML5)

1. Align attribute: The align attribute was commonly used to indicate how the other parts of a page should flow around an image.
                    It has been removed from HTML5 and handled in CSS3

* you can align an images in two ways:
1.left : This aligns the image to the left (allowing text to flow around its right-hand side).
2.right: This aligns the image to the right (allowing text to flow around its left-hand side).

IV. ALIGNING IMAGES VERTICALLY (It was in older code of HTML and not present in HTML5)

1. There are three values that the align attribute can take that control how the image should align vertically with the text that surrounds it.
 
1. top:    This aligns the first line of the surrounding text with the top of the image. 
2. middle: This aligns the first line of the surrounding text with the middle of the image.
3. bottom: This aligns the first line of the surrounding text with the bottom of the image

THREE RULES FOR CREATING IMAGES:

1. SAVE IMAGES IN THE RIGHT FORMAT.
2. SAVE IMAGES AT RIGHT SIZE.
3. USE THE CORRECT RESOLUTION.

1. SAVE IMAGES IN THE RIGHT FORMAT: Websites mainly use images in jpeg, gif, or png format. If you choose the wrong image format then your image might
                                    not look as sharp as it should and can make the web page slower to load.
								
2. SAVE IMAGES AT RIGHT SIZE: You should save the image at the same width and height it will appear on the website. If the image is smaller than the 
                              width or height that you have specified, the image can be distorted and stretched. If the image is larger than the width
                              and height if you have specified the image will take longer to display on the page.
							  
3. USE THE CORRECT RESOLUTION: Computer screens are made up of dots known as pixels. Images used on the web are also made up of tiny dots. Resolution refers
                               to the number of dots per inch, and most computer screens only show web pages at 72 pixels per inch. So saving images at
                               a higher resolution results in images that are larger than necessary and take longer to download.

V. HTML5 ELEMENTS FIGURE AND FIGURECAPTION:
   
1. <figure> tag        : Images often come with captions. 
                         HTML5 has introduced a new <figure> element to contain images and their caption so that the two are associated.

2. <figurecaption> tag : The <figcaption> element has been added to HTML5 in order to allow web page authors to add a caption to an image.
