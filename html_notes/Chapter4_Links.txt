Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another â€” enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing.

Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag. 
You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

Basic Syntax:
               <a href="http://www.imdb.com">IMDB</a>  --- while clicking on the IMDB we will be redirected to the IMDB website page.

There are 4 types of Links:

1. Linking To Other Sites:
   <a> tag: Links are created using the <a> element which has an attribute called href. The value of the href attribute is the page that
            you want people to go to when they click on the link.
			Users can click on anything that appears between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag and will be taken to the page
            specified in the href attribute.
			When you link to a different website, the value of the href attribute will be the full web address for the site, which is
            known as an absolute URL.
			e.g.:
			<p>Movie Reviews:
                 <ul>
                 <li><a href="http://www.empireonline.com">
                 Empire</a></li>
                 <li><a href="http://www.metacritic.com">
                 Metacritic</a></li>
                 <li><a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com">
                 Rotten Tomatoes</a></li>
                 <li><a href="http://www.variety.com">
                 Variety</a></li>
                 </ul>
            </p>

2. Linking to Other Pages on the Same Site: When you are linking to other pages within the same site,you do not need to specify the
                                            domain name in the URL. You can use a shorthand known as a relative URL.
											If all the pages of the site are in the same folder, then the value
                                            of the href attribute is just the name of the file.
											
			e.g.: No need to add domain.
			<p>
                 <ul>
                 <li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>
                 <li><a href="about-us.html">About</a></li>
                 <li><a href="movies.html">Movies</a></li>
                 <li><a href="contact.html">Contact</a></li>
                 </ul>
            </p>

3. mailto: To create a link that starts up the user's email program and addresses an email to a specified email address, you use the <a>
           element. However, this time the value of the href attribute starts with mailto: and is followed by the email address you want the
           email to be sent to.
		   e.g.:
		        <a href="mailto:jon@example.org">Email Jon</a>
				
4. Opening Links in a New Window: One of the most common reasons a web page author might want a link to be opened in a new window is if it points to
                                   another website. In such cases,they hope the user will return to the window containing their site 
								   after finishing looking at the other one.
    If you want a link to open in a new window, you can use the target attribute on the opening <a> tag. The value of this attribute should be _blank.							   
            e.g.:
                 <a href="http://www.imdb.com" target="_blank">Internet Movie Database</a> (opens in new window)			

5. Linking to a Specific Part of the Same Page:At the top of a long page you might want to add a list of contents that links to the corresponding sections lower
                                          down. Or you might want to add a link from part way down the page back to the top of it to save 
										  users from having to scroll back to the top.
										  
Before you can link to a specific part of a page, you need to identify the points in the page that the link will go to. 
You do this using the id attribute (which can be used on every HTML element). You can see that the <h1> and <h2> elements in this example have been given id
attributes that identify those sections of the page.
										  
			e.g.:
                <h1 id="top">Film-Making Terms</h1>
				<a href="#arc_shot">Arc Shot</a><br />
				<a href="#interlude">Interlude</a><br />
				<a href="#prologue">Prologue</a><br /><br />
				<h2 id="arc_shot">Arc Shot</h2>
				<p>A shot in which the subject is photographed by an
				encircling or moving camera</p>
				<h2 id="interlude">Interlude</h2>
				<p>A brief, intervening film scene or sequence, not
				specifically tied to the plot, that appears
				within a film</p>
				<h2 id="prologue">Prologue</h2>
				<p>A speech, preface, introduction, or brief scene
				preceding the the main action or plot of a film;
				contrast to epilogue</p>
				<p><a href="#top">Top</a></p>			
				
6. Linking to a Specific Part of Another Page: If you want to link to a specific part of a different page (whether on your own site or a different website) 
                                               you can use a similar technique.
											   
Therefore, the href attribute will contain the address for the page (either an absolute URL or a relative URL), followed by the # symbol
, followed by the value of the id attribute that is used on the element you are linking to.
For example, to link to the bottom of the homepage of the website that accompanies this book, you would write: <a href="http:/www.htmlandcssbookcom/#bottom">
